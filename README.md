# TÃ‚CHES' Spotify Label Playlist Creator

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- A Spotify Developer account

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/glittercowboy/spotify-playlist-creator.git
cd spotify-playlist-creator
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up Spotify Developer Credentials
- Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
- Create a new application
- Copy your Client ID and Client Secret
- Set the Redirect URI to `http://localhost:8888/callback`

4. Configure Environment Variables
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Fill in your Spotify Client ID, Client Secret, and Redirect URI

5. Run the Application
```bash
npm start
```
6. Open `http://localhost:8888` in your browser

7. Search for the exact label name as it appears on a release on Spotify.

For example (as the following photo demonstrates) - search for "Crosstown Rebels". You do not need to put the year as that's just when the release came out.

Some labels use a different name for the release, so be sure to look up the correct label name on Spotify. It might "XYZ RECORDINGS" or "XYZ RECORDS" or "XYZ MUSIC RELEASES LTD." or whatever.
